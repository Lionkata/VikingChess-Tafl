# VikingChess-Tafl


## Objective 
+ **The game pits `defenders`** _(centered around the `king`)_ **against `attackers` **_(surrounding the edges of the board)_.

+ **`Defenders'` goal: Help the king escape to a corner square.**

+ **`Attackers'` goal: Capture the king before he escapes.**

## Setup

+ **The board is typically square (7x7, 9x9, 11x11, 3x13).**

+ **The king starts in the center (throne).**

+ **Defenders surround the king.**

+ **Attackers are arranged around the edges of the board.**

## Gameplay
1. ### Turns:

   + Players alternate moves (attackers vs. defenders).
   + Any piece moves like a rook in chess (straight lines, any distance, no jumping over 
     others).
2. ### Capturing:

   + A piece is captured when it's flanked on opposite sides (horizontally or vertically) by two enemy pieces.
   + The king must be surrounded on all 4 sides to be captured.
  
3. ### Throne (Center Square):

   + Only the king can occupy the throne.
   + Enemy pieces cannot pass through or land on the throne.
4. ### Corners:

   + Only the king can escape to a corner square.
